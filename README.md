a. Pre-Requisite Steps:
 - You need Node.js installed (and npm, which comes with Node).
 
 - You should have a project folder with a package.json (or run npm init to create one).
 
 - Make sure your Node version meets Cypressâ€™s supported versions.
 
 - Cypress docs list the supported Node/browser versions

b. Installation Steps : 
 - Navigate to your project root in terminal / command prompt.
 
 - Install Cypress as a dev dependency:
 npm install --save-dev cypress

c. To verify the installation, run:
npx cypress open


2. Folder Structure 

/cypress.config.js                          # Main Cypress configuration file
/cypress
  /e2e                                      # End to End Spec files folder containing all the e2e tests.
  /fixtures                                 # Static data (JSON, etc.) used by tests
    example.json
  /support                                  # Support files loaded before each spec
    commands.js                             # Custom commands and utility functions
    e2e.js (or index.js)                    # Global setup / behavior before each test file
/screenshots (generated at runtime)           :contentReference
/ videos (generated at runtime)               :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
/ downloads (if using downloads in tests)     :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
